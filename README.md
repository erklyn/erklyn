Software Engineering Student trying to become a Fullstack Developer.

I am currently enrolled in Selcuk University studying to become a Computer Engineer but recently felt like I can learn more on my own as an engineer. Currently working in Serin Trailer Company designed , architect and developed their CRM Application and that gave me more experience than all of my 3 years in the University.
Started as a part time Tech Support in Serin currently working as a Full-Time Software Engineer.

My area of interest is Web Development but I have designed and developed iOS Apps so Mobile Development is also fun for me.
