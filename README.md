I am a JavaScript developer focusing on Backend most of my time but I consider myself a Full Stack Developer.
 I have developed and I am still developing with TypeScript on the Frontend and the Backend.
 On the backend Node.js is my go to technology but I can learn other languages for another backend system such as python or golang , I have developed with both GraphQL and REST Api currently trying to shift to Type Graphql and get more experienced on TypeOrm.

On the Frontend React and Vue Frameworks are my favorites. 
I Have worked with SQL based Databases such as Postgres and MySQL ,
And I have experience building apps with NOSQL Databases such as MongoDB and Google Firestore , I Have used Serverless Technologies such as Google Firebase and build applications with it. I have the most experience with MERN Stack.
