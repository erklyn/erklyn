Well being a Computer Engineering students , I can literally change what I want to focus on every know and then , all jokes aside , after many hours learning *JavaScript* , *Node* and *GraphQL* , *React* and other technologies 

I was sure I would be a web dev but I decide to pursue a different path not like 180 more like 33 - 25 degree different turn 

I decided on the Front-end I am just going for iOS development with *Swift* and Server Side of things I will focus on *Node js* with *graphql* and *typescript* and *Next.js*
