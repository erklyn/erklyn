Software Engineering Student trying to become a Fullstack Developer.

I am currently enrolled in Selcuk University studying to become a Computer Engineer but recently felt like I can learn more on my own as a developer as an engineer currently working in a Trailer Company designed , architect and developed their CRM Application and that gave me more experience than all my 3 years in University.
Started as a part time Tech Support in Serin currently working as a Full Time Software Engineer.

Web and Mobile Development is my kind of area of interest on the software development scene.
